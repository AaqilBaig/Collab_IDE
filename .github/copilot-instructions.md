## Project: Real-time Collaborative IDE

This project is a real-time collaborative code editor that allows multiple users to edit code simultaneously in the same file. Key technologies used:

1. **Frontend**: React, CodeMirror for the code editor component
2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express
3. **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO
4. **Authentication**: JWT for user authentication
5. **State Management**: React Context API or Redux
6. **UI Framework**: Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for responsive design

The application should focus on:
- Clean, modular code architecture
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Efficient real-time synchronization with minimal latency
- Proper error handling and user feedback
